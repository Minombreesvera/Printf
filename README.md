# printf()
A function called "_printf" imitates the genuine "printf" command found in the stdio.h library in the "printf" project, which was created in collaboration by **Minombreesvera(Kehinde Bolaji)** and **Oyematth01(Matthew Oyelami)** students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme at Holberton School. It includes some of the basic features and functions listed in man 3 of "printf".
_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and prints data. 
Its prototype include the following:

	int _printf(const char *format, ...)

This function **\_printf()** writes output to stdout, the standard output stream with the format and options without making use of any of the standard library files. It was written to use a local buffer of 1024 bytes when printing although it can print larger sets of data.

The \_printf() function returns the total number of characters printed to the stdout(excluding the null byte at the end of strings) after a successful execution.

If an output error is encountered, a negative value of -1 is returned.

The prototype of this function is:  **int _printf(const char *format, ...);*** as stated earlier.

This means that it has one mandatory format argument, and an extra number of arguments that can be none, or many.
Where **format** contains the string that is printed. As _printf() is a variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.


**Format of the format string**

The format string is a character string starting and ending with double quotes. The format string is composed of zero or more directives; ordinary characters (not %), and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. 

Each conversion specification is introduced by the character **%** and ends with a **conversion specifier**.

The format tags prototype is the following:

	%[flags][length]specifier
	
If the program runs successfully, the **return value** is the amount of chars printed.
	
| Specifier | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| c  | Character  |
| d or i | Signed decimal integer |
| s  | String of characters  |
| b  | Signed binary  |
| o  | Signed octal  |
| u  | Unsigned integer  |
| x  | Unsigned hexadecimal  |
| X  | Unsigned hexadecimal (uppercase)  |
| p  | Pointer address  |
| r  | Reverse string of characters |
| R  | ROT13 translation of string |
| S  | String with special chars replaced by their ASCII value  |
| %  | Character  |

| Flags | Description | Specifiers |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| +  | Prints a plus sign (+) when the argument is a positive number. In other case, prints a minus sign (-). | i, d |
| (space) | Prints a blank space if the argument is a positive number | i, d |
| #  | Prints 0, 0x and 0X for o, x and X specifiers, respectively. It doesn't print anything if the argument is zero | o, x, X |

| Length | Description | Specifiers |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| l | Prints a long int or unsigned long int | i, d, o, u, x and X |
| h | Prints a short int or unsigned short int | i, d, o, u, x and X |
|--|--|
|**d, i**|The argument **int** is converted to a signed decimal notation. If precision is present,it gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, then it is padded with zeros on the left. Default precision is 1.|
|**o, u, x, X**|The argument is converted to unsigned octal (**o**), unsigned decimal (**u**), or unsigned hexamedical (**x** and **X**) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversion. If precision is present, it will give  the  minimum  number  of  digits  that  must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, then it will be padded with zeros. By default the precision is 1.  |
|**c**|The  int argument is converted to an unsigned char and the resulting character is written. The representation of characters is based off the ASCII coding.|
|**s**|The argument received is expected to be a pointer type char * to an array of characters.  Characters from this array are printed up  to  (but  not including) a null byte  (**'\0'**).  If precision is specified, then this will determine how many characters are taken into account for printing.|
|**p**|A void * pointer argument is printed as hexadecimal in lower caps representing an adress in memory.|
|**%**|A  ' **%** ' character is written and no conversion is made. The specification is as follows: **%%**. |
|**b**|The argument is converted to an unsigned int value and then operated to get its binary representation (base 2).|
|**S**| The  argument  received  is expected to be a pointer type char * to an array of characters.  Characters from this array are printed up to (but not including) a null byte  ('\0').  Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by  the  ASCII  code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters). |
|**r**|The  argument received is expected to be a pointer type char * to an array of characters.  Characters from this array are printed in reverse order up to (but not including) a null byte  ('\0').  |
|**R**|The argument received is expected to be a pointer type char * to an array of characters.  Characters from this array  are  encoded  to  ROT13  and printed in order up to (but not including a null byte  ('\0').  |

## Examples

1. Printing the string of chars "Hello, Holberton":
	+ Use: `_printf("Hello Hol%s.", "berton");`
	+ Output: `Hello Holberton.`
	
2. Printing an integer number:
	+ Use: `_printf("10 + 10 is equal to %d.", 20);`
	+ Output: `10 + 10 is equal to 20.`
	
3. Printing a binary, octal and hexadecimal:
	+ Use: `_printf("10 in binary is [%b], in octal is [%o] and in hexadecimal is [%x]", 5, 5, 5);`
	+ Output: `10 in binary is [1010], in octal is [12] and in hexadecimal is [A]`
	
4. Printing a string codified in ROT13:
	+ Use: `_printf("Hello in ROT13 is %R", "Hello");`
	+ Output: `Hello in ROT13 is Urybb`

Using flags and length tags:

5. Printing the string of chars "Hello, Holberton":
	+ Use: `_printf("2 * 2 = %+d and 5 * -5 = %+i", 4, -25);`
	+ Output: `2 * 2 = +4 and 5 * -5 = -25`
	
6. Printing a long integer number and short integer number:
	+ Use: `_printf("1 million as a long int is %ld, but as a short int is %hd", 1000000, 1000000);`
	+ Output: `1 million as a long int is 1000000, but as a short int is 16960`
